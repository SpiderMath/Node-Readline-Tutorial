# Node-Readline-Tutorial <br>

Hello guys, [Defective Detective](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQvyfLaZOG4bPwEvqSYCLg) here.<br>

This repository is for my [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTknGVAvAak) on the [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) package, which is a built-in (aka core) module of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)<br>

This repository has been moved [here]() to continue the series as Node.js Basics. Get the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNnNNVAPtEpQe3x7-i-XZMwVaCW2pY93t).<br>

You can find the code in [here](./Source) and hope that helped!
